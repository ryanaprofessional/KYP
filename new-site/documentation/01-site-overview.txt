SITE OVERVIEW - UNDERSTANDING THE WEBSITE BASICS
===================================================

WHAT IS A WEBSITE?
-----------------
A website is a collection of files that work together to create what you see in your web browser. Think of it like a digital brochure or magazine that people can view on their computers and phones.

THE THREE MAIN PARTS
--------------------

1. HTML FILES (.html)
   - These contain the content and structure (text, images, links)
   - Like the skeleton of a house - they define what goes where
   - Examples: index.html, store.html, contact.html

2. CSS FILES (.css) 
   - These control how everything looks (colors, fonts, layout)
   - Like the paint and decorations of a house
   - Located in the "styles" folder

3. JAVASCRIPT FILES (.js)
   - These make things interactive (buttons, menus, pop-ups)
   - Like the electrical system of a house
   - Main file: script.js

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU
----------------------
- To change content, edit the .html files
- To change colors or layout, edit the .css files
- To change interactive features, edit script.js
- To add images, put them in the images folder
- To add documents, put them in the files folder

BASIC WEB DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS
-----------------------------

HTML TAGS:
HTML uses "tags" to define content. Tags are surrounded by < and >
Example: <h1>This is a heading</h1>
- <h1> starts the heading
- </h1> ends the heading
- The text between them is what appears on the page

COMMON HTML TAGS YOU'LL SEE:
- <h1>, <h2>, <h3> = Headings (different sizes)
- <p> = Paragraph of text
- <a href="..."> = Links to other pages
- <img src="..."> = Images
- <div> = Container for grouping content
- <button> = Clickable buttons

CSS CLASSES:
CSS uses "classes" to style elements. Classes start with a dot (.)
Example: .store-card { background: white; }
This makes all elements with class="store-card" have a white background

JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS:
JavaScript uses "functions" to make things happen
Example: function openModal() { ... }
This creates a function that can be called when someone clicks something

TESTING YOUR CHANGES
--------------------
1. Make your changes in a text editor
2. Save the file
3. Open (or refresh) the website in your browser
4. Check that everything looks correct
5. Test on mobile by making your browser window very narrow

Remember: Always keep backup copies of files before making changes!
