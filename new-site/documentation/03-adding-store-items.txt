ADDING STORE ITEMS - HOW TO ADD NEW MERCHANDISE
===================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The store page displays merchandise (currently shirts) that people can view and purchase through the donation page. Each item shows an image, title, and purchase button.

WHAT YOU'LL NEED
---------------
- Image file of the new merchandise (PNG or JPG format)
- Name/title for the item
- Basic text editing skills

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

STEP 1: PREPARE THE IMAGE
1. Get a high-quality image of your merchandise
2. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger
3. Save it as a PNG or JPG file
4. Give it a descriptive name (example: "KYP_New_Design.png")
5. Copy the image file to: new-site/images/store/

STEP 2: EDIT THE STORE PAGE
1. Open "store.html" in a text editor (like Notepad)
2. Find the section that starts with <div class="store-grid">
3. You'll see existing store cards that look like this:

<div class="store-card">
    <div class="store-image-container" onclick="openImageModal('images/store/kyp.png', 'KYP Shirt')">
        <img src="images/store/kyp.png" alt="KYP Shirt" class="store-image">
        <div class="image-overlay">
            <span class="view-fullscreen">üîç View Full Size</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="store-card-content">
        <h4 class="store-item-title">KYP Shirt</h4>
        <button class="purchase-btn" onclick="goToDonate()">Purchase</button>
    </div>
</div>

STEP 3: ADD YOUR NEW ITEM
1. Copy one of the existing store card blocks (everything from <div class="store-card"> to </div>)
2. Paste it after the last existing store card
3. Update the following parts:

CHANGE THESE PARTS:
- Replace 'images/store/kyp.png' with your new image path (appears twice)
- Replace 'KYP Shirt' with your new item name (appears three times)

EXAMPLE - ADDING A NEW HAT:
<div class="store-card">
    <div class="store-image-container" onclick="openImageModal('images/store/KYP_Hat.png', 'KYP Hat')">
        <img src="images/store/KYP_Hat.png" alt="KYP Hat" class="store-image">
        <div class="image-overlay">
            <span class="view-fullscreen">üîç View Full Size</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="store-card-content">
        <h4 class="store-item-title">KYP Hat</h4>
        <button class="purchase-btn" onclick="goToDonate()">Purchase</button>
    </div>
</div>

STEP 4: SAVE AND TEST
1. Save the store.html file
2. Open store.html in your web browser
3. Check that your new item appears
4. Click on the image to make sure the full-size view works
5. Click the Purchase button to make sure it goes to the donation page
6. Test on mobile by making your browser window narrow

UNDERSTANDING THE CODE
---------------------

WHAT EACH PART DOES:

<div class="store-card">
- Creates a container for one store item

<div class="store-image-container" onclick="openImageModal('images/store/KYP_Hat.png', 'KYP Hat')">
- Creates the image area
- onclick="openImageModal(...)" makes the image clickable to show full size
- First parameter: path to your image file
- Second parameter: name of your item

<img src="images/store/KYP_Hat.png" alt="KYP Hat" class="store-image">
- Displays the actual image
- src: path to your image file
- alt: description for screen readers and if image doesn't load

<div class="image-overlay">
- Creates the "View Full Size" overlay that appears on hover (desktop only)

<h4 class="store-item-title">KYP Hat</h4>
- Displays the item name below the image

<button class="purchase-btn" onclick="goToDonate()">Purchase</button>
- Creates the purchase button that redirects to donation page

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
------------------------

WRONG IMAGE PATH:
‚ùå src="KYP_Hat.png" (missing folder path)
‚úÖ src="images/store/KYP_Hat.png" (correct path)

MISMATCHED NAMES:
‚ùå Image file: "hat.png" but code says "KYP_Hat.png"
‚úÖ Make sure the filename in your code exactly matches the actual file

MISSING QUOTES:
‚ùå onclick=openImageModal(images/store/hat.png, Hat)
‚úÖ onclick="openImageModal('images/store/hat.png', 'Hat')"

FORGETTING TO UPDATE ALL INSTANCES:
- The image path appears twice in each store card
- The item name appears three times in each store card
- Make sure to update ALL of them

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------

PROBLEM: Image doesn't show up
SOLUTION: 
- Check that the image file is in new-site/images/store/
- Check that the filename in the code exactly matches the actual file
- Check that the image path starts with "images/store/"

PROBLEM: Clicking image doesn't open full-size view
SOLUTION:
- Check that both image paths in the onclick and src are correct
- Make sure the item name in quotes matches exactly

PROBLEM: Purchase button doesn't work
SOLUTION:
- Make sure the button code is exactly: onclick="goToDonate()"
- Check that script.js file is present and linked in the HTML

PROBLEM: New item appears in wrong place
SOLUTION:
- Make sure you pasted the new store card inside the <div class="store-grid"> section
- Make sure you didn't accidentally paste it inside another store card

ADVANCED TIPS
------------

ORGANIZING ITEMS:
- Items appear in the order they're written in the HTML
- To reorder items, cut and paste the entire store card blocks
- Consider grouping similar items together

IMAGE OPTIMIZATION:
- Larger images take longer to load
- Consider resizing images to 400x400 pixels for faster loading
- Use PNG for images with text or sharp edges
- Use JPG for photographs

ADDING CATEGORIES:
If you want to add different types of merchandise (hats, stickers, etc.):
1. Add a new heading before the new items:
   <h2 class="store-section-title">Hats</h2>
2. This will create a section header like the existing "Shirts" section

TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------
After adding a new store item, test:

‚ñ° Image displays correctly on desktop
‚ñ° Image displays correctly on mobile
‚ñ° Clicking image opens full-size modal
‚ñ° Modal shows correct image and title
‚ñ° Purchase button works in both card and modal
‚ñ° Item title displays correctly
‚ñ° Layout looks good with the new item added
‚ñ° No other items were accidentally broken

Remember: Always keep a backup copy of store.html before making changes!
