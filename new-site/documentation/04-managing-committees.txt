MANAGING COMMITTEES - UPDATING EXECUTIVE AND VISION COMMITTEE MEMBERS
========================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The home page (index.html) displays two committees:
- Executive Committee (7 members)
- Vision Committee (2 members)

Each member is shown as a card with their name and role. This guide shows you how to add, remove, or update committee members.

WHERE TO FIND COMMITTEE INFORMATION
----------------------------------
Committee members are displayed on the home page (index.html) in two sections:
1. Executive Committee section
2. Vision Committee section

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

STEP 1: OPEN THE HOME PAGE FILE
1. Open "index.html" in a text editor (like Notepad)
2. Look for these sections:
   - <!-- Executive Committee Section -->
   - <!-- Vision Committee Section -->

STEP 2: FIND THE COMMITTEE SECTIONS
Look for this code structure:

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SECTION:
<section class="content-section">
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Executive Committee</h2>
    <div class="committee-grid">
        <!-- Member cards go here -->
    </div>
    <div class="divider"></div>
</section>

VISION COMMITTEE SECTION:
<section class="content-section">
    <h2 class="sub-heading">Vision Committee</h2>
    <div class="committee-grid">
        <!-- Member cards go here -->
    </div>
</section>

STEP 3: UNDERSTAND MEMBER CARD STRUCTURE
Each committee member is represented by this code:

<div class="member-card">
    <div class="member-info">
        <h3 class="member-name">Geoff Sebesta</h3>
        <p class="member-role">Chair</p>
    </div>
</div>

WHAT EACH PART DOES:
- <div class="member-card"> = Container for one member
- <h3 class="member-name"> = Person's name
- <p class="member-role"> = Their role/position

ADDING A NEW COMMITTEE MEMBER
-----------------------------

STEP 1: DECIDE WHICH COMMITTEE
- Executive Committee: Add to the first committee-grid section
- Vision Committee: Add to the second committee-grid section

STEP 2: COPY AN EXISTING MEMBER CARD
1. Find an existing member card in the same committee
2. Copy the entire block from <div class="member-card"> to </div>
3. Paste it after the last member in that committee

STEP 3: UPDATE THE INFORMATION
Change these parts:
- Replace the name between <h3 class="member-name"> and </h3>
- Replace the role between <p class="member-role"> and </p>

EXAMPLE - ADDING A NEW EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER:
<div class="member-card">
    <div class="member-info">
        <h3 class="member-name">Jane Smith</h3>
        <p class="member-role">Committee Member</p>
    </div>
</div>

REMOVING A COMMITTEE MEMBER
---------------------------

STEP 1: FIND THE MEMBER TO REMOVE
1. Look through the committee sections
2. Find the member card with the person's name

STEP 2: DELETE THE ENTIRE MEMBER CARD
1. Select everything from <div class="member-card"> to the matching </div>
2. Delete the entire block
3. Make sure you don't accidentally delete parts of other member cards

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------

PROBLEM: Member cards look broken or misaligned
SOLUTION: 
- Check that each member card has matching opening and closing tags
- Make sure you didn't accidentally delete part of the HTML structure
- Verify that each <div> has a matching </div>

PROBLEM: Names or roles don't display correctly
SOLUTION:
- Check that text is between the correct tags
- Make sure you didn't accidentally delete the <h3> or <p> tags
- Verify there are no extra characters or symbols

PROBLEM: New member doesn't appear
SOLUTION:
- Make sure you added the member card inside the correct committee-grid section
- Check that the HTML structure is complete
- Verify you saved the file after making changes

PROBLEM: Page layout is broken
SOLUTION:
- Check that you didn't accidentally modify the committee-grid or content-section tags
- Make sure all HTML tags are properly closed
- Try undoing your changes and starting over more carefully

STYLING NOTES
------------
The appearance of committee member cards is controlled by CSS files:
- styles/committees.css - Main styling for member cards
- styles/responsive.css - Mobile/tablet adjustments

You don't need to modify these files unless you want to change colors, fonts, or layout.

TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------
After making committee changes, test:

□ All member names display correctly
□ All member roles display correctly  
□ Cards are properly aligned
□ Layout looks good on desktop
□ Layout looks good on mobile (narrow browser window)
□ No HTML errors or broken formatting
□ Both Executive and Vision Committee sections work properly

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
---------------
- Always make a backup copy of index.html before editing
- Make one change at a time and test it
- Be very careful with HTML tags - they must match exactly
- When copying member cards, copy the entire block including all tags
- Test your changes in a web browser after saving

Remember: Committee member information only appears on the home page (index.html). Changes here don't affect other pages.
