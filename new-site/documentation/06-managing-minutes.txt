MANAGING MEETING MINUTES - ADDING MEETING MINUTES
===================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
The minutes page (minutes.html) displays meeting minutes organized by date. Each minute entry shows as a card with the meeting date and a button to open the PDF document.

WHERE MINUTES ARE STORED
------------------------
- PDF files: stored in new-site/files/minutes/
- Display information: coded in minutes.html

CURRENT MINUTES AVAILABLE
-------------------------
The website currently has these meeting minutes:
- December 2024 (2024_12.pdf)
- January 2025 (2025_1.pdf)
- February 2025 (2025_2.pdf)
- March 2025 (2025_3.pdf)
- April 2025 (2025_4.pdf)

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

STEP 1: PREPARE THE MINUTES PDF
1. Get the meeting minutes in PDF format
2. Name the file using this format: YYYY_M.pdf
   - YYYY = 4-digit year
   - M = month number (1-12, no leading zero)
   - Examples: 2025_5.pdf, 2025_12.pdf
3. Copy the PDF file to: new-site/files/minutes/

STEP 2: OPEN THE MINUTES PAGE
1. Open "minutes.html" in a text editor (like Notepad)
2. Look for the section with <div class="minutes-grid">

STEP 3: UNDERSTAND MINUTE CARD STRUCTURE
Each minute entry uses this code:

<div class="minute-card">
    <h4>April 2025</h4>
    <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_4.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
</div>

WHAT EACH PART DOES:
- <div class="minute-card"> = Container for one minute entry
- <h4> = Display name (Month Year)
- <button> = Button to open the PDF
- onclick="openMinutePdf('...')" = Function that opens the PDF file

STEP 4: ADD A NEW MINUTE ENTRY

FIND THE MINUTES GRID:
Look for this section in minutes.html:
<div class="minutes-grid">
    <!-- Existing minute cards are here -->
</div>

COPY AN EXISTING MINUTE CARD:
1. Find an existing minute card
2. Copy everything from <div class="minute-card"> to </div>
3. Paste it at the TOP of the minutes-grid (for newest first order)

UPDATE THE INFORMATION:
Change these parts:
- Display name: Change "April 2025" to your new month/year
- File path: Change "files/minutes/2025_4.pdf" to your new file path

EXAMPLE - ADDING MAY 2025 MINUTES:
<div class="minute-card">
    <h4>May 2025</h4>
    <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_5.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
</div>

COMPLETE EXAMPLE - ADDING NEW MINUTES
------------------------------------

BEFORE (existing minutes):
<div class="minutes-grid">
    <div class="minute-card">
        <h4>April 2025</h4>
        <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_4.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
    </div>
    <div class="minute-card">
        <h4>March 2025</h4>
        <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_3.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
    </div>
    <!-- More existing minutes... -->
</div>

AFTER (with May 2025 added):
<div class="minutes-grid">
    <div class="minute-card">
        <h4>May 2025</h4>
        <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_5.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
    </div>
    <div class="minute-card">
        <h4>April 2025</h4>
        <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_4.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
    </div>
    <div class="minute-card">
        <h4>March 2025</h4>
        <button class="btn" onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_3.pdf')">View Minutes</button>
    </div>
    <!-- More existing minutes... -->
</div>

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

PDF FILE NAMES:
- Format: YYYY_M.pdf
- Year: 4 digits (2025, 2026, etc.)
- Month: 1 or 2 digits (1, 2, 3... 10, 11, 12)
- Examples:
  - January 2025: 2025_1.pdf
  - October 2025: 2025_10.pdf
  - December 2025: 2025_12.pdf

DISPLAY NAMES:
- Format: "Month YYYY"
- Use full month names
- Examples:
  - "January 2025"
  - "October 2025"
  - "December 2025"

ORGANIZING MINUTES
-----------------

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER:
- Newest minutes should appear first (at the top)
- This helps visitors find recent minutes quickly
- When adding new minutes, put them at the beginning of the minutes-grid

YEARLY ORGANIZATION:
If you have many minutes, consider adding year headers:

<div class="minutes-container">
    <h3>2025 Meeting Minutes</h3>
    <div class="minutes-grid">
        <!-- 2025 minutes here -->
    </div>
</div>

<div class="minutes-container">
    <h3>2024 Meeting Minutes</h3>
    <div class="minutes-grid">
        <!-- 2024 minutes here -->
    </div>
</div>

UPDATING EXISTING MINUTES
-------------------------

TO REPLACE A MINUTE FILE:
1. Replace the PDF file in new-site/files/minutes/
2. Keep the same filename
3. No changes needed in minutes.html

TO CHANGE A DISPLAY NAME:
1. Find the minute card in minutes.html
2. Change the text between <h4> and </h4>

TO REMOVE OLD MINUTES:
1. Delete the minute card from minutes.html
2. Optionally delete the PDF file from new-site/files/minutes/

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------

PROBLEM: "View Minutes" button doesn't work
SOLUTION:
- Check that the PDF file exists in new-site/files/minutes/
- Verify the filename in the onclick matches the actual file exactly
- Make sure the file path starts with "files/minutes/"

PROBLEM: New minute doesn't appear
SOLUTION:
- Make sure you added the minute card inside the minutes-grid section
- Check that the HTML structure is complete
- Verify you saved the file after making changes

PROBLEM: PDF opens but shows error or blank page
SOLUTION:
- Check that the PDF file isn't corrupted
- Try opening the PDF file directly to test it
- Make sure the PDF is a valid, readable document

PROBLEM: Minutes appear in wrong order
SOLUTION:
- Remember that newest minutes should be at the top
- Move minute cards by cutting and pasting entire blocks
- Check that you're adding new minutes at the beginning of minutes-grid

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
-----------------------

WRONG FILE PATH:
❌ onclick="openMinutePdf('2025_5.pdf')" (missing folder path)
✅ onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_5.pdf')" (correct path)

MISMATCHED FILENAMES:
❌ File: "may_2025.pdf" but code says "2025_5.pdf"
✅ Make sure the filename in your code exactly matches the actual file

INCONSISTENT NAMING:
❌ Mixing formats like "2025_5.pdf" and "May-2025.pdf"
✅ Use consistent YYYY_M.pdf format for all files

MISSING QUOTES:
❌ onclick=openMinutePdf(files/minutes/2025_5.pdf)
✅ onclick="openMinutePdf('files/minutes/2025_5.pdf')"

TECHNICAL DETAILS
----------------

HOW THE PDF OPENING WORKS:
The openMinutePdf function is defined in script.js:
- It takes the file path as a parameter
- Opens the PDF in a new browser tab/window
- This allows people to view or download the minutes

THE FUNCTION LOOKS LIKE THIS:
function openMinutePdf(pdfPath) {
    window.open(pdfPath, '_blank');
}

You don't need to modify this function - just use it correctly in the onclick attributes.

TESTING CHECKLIST
-----------------
After adding new meeting minutes, test:

□ PDF file is in the correct folder (new-site/files/minutes/)
□ Filename follows YYYY_M.pdf format
□ New minute card appears on the minutes page
□ Display name is correct (Month YYYY format)
□ "View Minutes" button works and opens the correct PDF
□ PDF opens in a new tab and displays correctly
□ Minutes are in chronological order (newest first)
□ Layout looks good on both desktop and mobile

BEST PRACTICES
--------------

REGULAR UPDATES:
- Add new minutes promptly after each meeting
- Keep minutes organized and easy to find
- Consider archiving very old minutes if the list gets too long

FILE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep PDF files reasonably sized (under 5MB if possible)
- Use descriptive but consistent filenames
- Back up PDF files in addition to the website

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Ensure PDF files are readable and well-formatted
- Consider providing text summaries for key decisions
- Make sure PDFs work well on mobile devices

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
---------------
- Always test the PDF link after adding new minutes
- Keep a backup of both the PDF file and the updated HTML
- Use consistent naming conventions to avoid confusion
- Add new minutes at the top of the list for easy access
- Double-check file paths and filenames for accuracy

Remember: Meeting minutes are important historical records. Keep them organized, accessible, and properly archived!
